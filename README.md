MealBucks:

Purpose:

MealBucks is an innovative app that aims to make meal planning simple, affordable, and nutritious for schools, homeless shelters, and other organizations. With its user-friendly frontend interface, the app is designed to provide meal plans and recipes that are both affordable and nutritious, making meal planning a breeze.

Requirements:

The app will require a frontend user interface, which can be made using a framework (some of which include React and Electron).

In addition to the user interface, the app will also need to be able to create or obtain meal plans or budgets. This will be done in a conversational format similar to ChatGPT, except with GPT NeoX as the text generation model. This will be done by fine-tuning the model on conversational data to learn the dialogue format, RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback), and recipe data collected from the internet. To achieve this, the app will require the use of cloud TPUs (which do cost money but Google Cloud has a free trial of 300 bucks, and if needed, I will pay for it). Overall, MealBucks is the perfect solution for organizations looking to streamline their meal planning process while ensuring that meals are affordable, nutritious, and delicious.
