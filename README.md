MealBucks:

Purpose:

The purpose of this app is to recommend meal plans and recipes to schools, homeless shelters, and other organizations,
that are affordable and nutritious and make the planning experience as simple as possible. 

Requirements:

The app will require a frontend user interface, which can be made using a framework (some of which include React and Electron).
In addition to the user interface, the app will also need to be able to obtain meal ideas from the internet,
which will be done using a web scraper. This will likely be written in Python. Furthermore, the app also needs a recommendation system,
which will output meal plans to the user. This will take into account the estimated price of the meals,
whether or not the meals meet a certain nutrition threshold, and may also take into account user-provided data such as how popular the meal was.
